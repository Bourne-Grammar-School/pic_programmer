** Describe it
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- Click on this [[http://www.driving-school-beckenham.co.uk/pedestriancrossings.html][link ]]
- Describe the four different pedesterian crossings either in words or as a flowchart.
- Think about how we could program them using our PIC license.
- How many inputs and outputs would we need?
- Are the inputs digital or analogue?
- How important are the timings/wait commands?
* Homework Task 2
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
** Research it
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
- Our PIC license board has 3 LED outputs and one analogue input (LDR).
- Make a list, at least 5, of different inputs and outputs we could have had on our board.
For each component:
   - Explain what it does
   - How it could be a useful addition to our board or a project you could make.
   - Find images. 
* Homework Task 3

** Design it
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: design
:END:
- Design a brief plan and/or write a short description of project that involves using a PIC.
- Need inspiration? Try look at [[https://www.arduino.cc][Arduino]] or the Instructables [[http://www.instructables.com/howto/pic/][site]].
